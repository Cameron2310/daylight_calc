<h1>Daylight Calculator</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
I built this project to develop a better understanding of APIs and OOP. This project takes the coordinates from a city and then pushes those coordinates to another API in order to find the daylight length. Daylight calculator does this for several days in each season and then finds the average for each season and shows it in a graph.

<h2>How to use Daylight Calculator:</h2>
    1) Clone the repository to your local machine
    2) If you do not have matplotlib or requests library, you will need those for the program to work
    3) Create a free account on Position Stack to get an access token
        - Position stack requires a token to access its services
    4) Run the main.py file


<h2>Special thanks to Position Stack API & Sunrise-Sunset API:</h2>

https://sunrise-sunset.org/api - Sunrise Sunset (retrives information about sunrise, sunset, daylength, etc.)
