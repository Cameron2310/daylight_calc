Daylight Calculator

Overview:
I built this project to develop a better understanding of APIs and OOP. This project takes the coordinates from a city and then pushes those coordinates to another API in order to find the daylight length. Daylight calculator does this for several days in each season and then finds the average for each season and shows it in a graph.

How to use Daylight Calculator:
    1) Clone the repository to your local machine
    2) Create a free account on Position Stack to get an access token
        - Position stack requires a token to access its services
    3) Run the main.py file


Special thanks to Position Stack API & Sunrise-Sunset API:
